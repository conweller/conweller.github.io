# Who am I?

![This is me](assets/images/headshot.png){width="50%"}

My name is Connor Onweller. I am a graduate student at the University of
Delaware, where I am working on a PhD in computer science.

I am primarily interested in applications of natural language processing
and computer vision. I am especially interesting in NLP and vision
applications that can make computers more accessible.

Outside of this I also have interests in effective software engineering
practices, text editors, and graphic design.

Here is my updated resume.
